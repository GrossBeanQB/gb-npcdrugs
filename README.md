Hi.

This is a lite script which allows you to sell drugs to any npc you approach.

It gives this somewhat realistic feeling to it.

There is a possibility that people get angry and call the cops on you, decline the offer.

There is a chance they steal some of your drugs and they run away.

They say "Hi" or a voice-line when you approach them and use qb-target at them which would appear only if you have drugs in your iventory 

" Greet Local "

Afterwards you get the prompt " Offer Drugs ".

When you knock out the ped or kill them , you can search them and retrieve the drugs back.

This is unfinished script, but working.

If you wish to expand it and add some animations and change to your liking do whatever you'd like to it.

This is created for people who are trying to learn how to make scripts in QBcore and just starting off with LUA and so on.

Hope you find this script interesting and feel free to comment if you encounter any issue.

In the future I may update this and add some more "realistic" feel to it.

Also police get notified for suspicous activity if some other npc in nearby distance "snitches" on your drug sale.

No progressbar was added.

Limited animations.

No frozen peds.

I made it like this on purpose so people can find a way themselves on how to make the npc freeze in place, turn around towards you if you greet them from the back and so on.

In my opinion it's a good learning "curve" for starters.

Good luck and have fun.
